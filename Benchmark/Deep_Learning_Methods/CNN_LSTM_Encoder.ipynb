As the data dimension is high we planned to use deep learning-based models to generate the latent representation of each day and then generate clusters for 365 days.\n","\n","As our dataset has spatial and temporal features, therefore we have developed a new CNN-LSTM model that learns the spatial features first from the dataset by considering the data of each day as an image of 41x41x7 dimension. The output of the CNN model is then passed through the LSTM model to learn the temporal features and generate the final latent variables. Using the final latent variables we perform the clustering to 365 days into different groups. During the training process, we try to reduce the clustering loss by learning better latent representations.  "],"metadata":{"id":"Zka-keupt31o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **1.
